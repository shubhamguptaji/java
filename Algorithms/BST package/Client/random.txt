Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two
teams of eleven players on a field at the centre
of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket
at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking
the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the
bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss
each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include
being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the
bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is
hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players
have been dismissed, the innings end and the teams swap roles.
The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire
and match referee in international matches. They communicate
with two off-field scorers who record the match's
statistical information.
There are various formats ranging from Twenty20, played
over a few hours with each team batting for a single
innings of 20 overs, to Test matches, played over five
days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for
two innings of unlimited length. Traditionally cricketers
play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they
wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit,
some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused
by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed
leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core
which is layered with tightly wound string.
